# Changelog

All platform packages are released in lockstep under one version. Before 1.0 a minor version may
contain breaking changes; a patch version does not.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **API reference:** an instance serves the OpenAPI document of the operations it runs at
  `GET /api/v1/openapi.json` and the same document as a page at `GET /api/v1/docs`. Both
  answer any signed-in person and any access token, whatever its scopes, and refuse a caller
  without a credential. The page holds no script and loads nothing from another host. The
  docs site has an "API Reference" section written from the release's document at build time.
- **API contract:** `openapi.json` is an OpenAPI 3.1 document with the release version, named
  schemas, the credentials each operation accepts with the scope it needs, an answer for every
  error code, `text/event-stream` and 204 for a stream, and the effect, rights and rate class
  of each operation as `x-catalyst-*` fields. It ships in `@vivd-catalyst/api-contract` as
  `@vivd-catalyst/api-contract/openapi.json`. `pnpm generate:openapi` writes it;
  `pnpm check:openapi` fails when it is stale or has a lint finding; `pnpm check:contract`
  fails on a change that breaks a caller of the newest release whose document has `/api/v1`
  paths, and passes with a notice while no such release exists. Both run in `pnpm check`.
  The package also exports `findBreakingChanges`, `describeApiReference` and
  `renderApiReferencePage`.

- **Chat:** the composer's model selector is a model picker. It opens as a short menu with the
  model and its reasoning effort; the model list shows each model's provider logo and an EU
  mark for providers with `compliance.residency: eu`, and a model under the pointer brings up a
  card with its description and usage consumption. A model binding can carry `description`,
  `vendor` and `usageTier` for it. The usage tier comes from the Customer Rate Card unless the
  binding sets one.
- **Chat:** users can pick the reasoning effort of a model: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`
  or `max` unless the binding's `userSelectableReasoningEfforts` lists others, and an empty
  list turns the choice off. `max` is a new reasoning effort, also available in agent model
  settings. The agent's configured effort stays the default. The run
  API accepts `reasoningEffort` and rejects an effort the model that runs does not offer. A
  migration adds `agent_runs.reasoning_effort`.
- **Chat:** a model or reasoning effort the user picks becomes their default for new
  conversations, on every device. A conversation that already ran stays on what its latest run
  used, and a user who never picked anything follows the configured defaults. The pick is
  stored per user (`/api/v1/me/model-preference`); a migration adds `product_users.model_preference`.
- **Workspaces:** a superadmin is Owner of every Shared Workspace without being a member. The
  workspace selector lists them under "Other workspaces"; the superadmin can open their
  settings, manage members and access requests, and read and start conversations there.
  Private conversations stay with their author and Personal Workspaces with their user. A
  workspace in the API carries `membershipRole` (`null` without a membership) next to `role`,
  which is what the caller may do.

### Changed

- **Chat:** the display panel is the surface slot. A tool display or a file preview stands
  beside the conversation while both sides keep 380 px, which is from 760 px of main area, and
  covers the main area below that, where its header offers "Show chat" alone. The former drawer
  below 1024 px is gone. The width is free, is remembered in the browser per kind of surface
  and is clamped so neither side falls below 380 px. The handle is the line between the two
  sides: the arrow keys move it 16 px, Home and End go to the limits. Fullscreen shows "Show
  chat" beside its controls. Nothing animates when the surface opens or resizes.
- **Chat UI:** `ToolDisplayPanel` and `ToolDisplayPanelFrame` are replaced by `SurfaceSlot` and
  the library's `SurfaceFrame`. The standalone app builds its routes from one table,
  `chat-ui/src/routes.ts`; every address keeps its path.
- **Limits:** five defaults that failed honest use are raised. A model call is tried three
  times, waiting about 1 s and then about 4 s, so a run survives two rate limit answers in a
  row. An approval check may take 60 s (was 10 s); a blocking rule that runs out of time says
  so. A spreadsheet previews up to 50,000 cells per sheet or range (was 5,000), and the stored
  failure names the limit. A preview embedded in a message is read up to 500 pages (was 200),
  the same ceiling the preview worker uses, exported as `ARTIFACT_PREVIEW_MAX_PAGES` from
  `@vivd-catalyst/core`. A Mailjet send may take 30 s (was 10 s).
  A provider's `Retry-After` replaces the fixed wait up to 60 s; a longer one fails the run at
  once, and no attempt or wait starts past a run's deadline. The preview renderer version is
  `preview-contract-v2`, so every stored preview, including sheets that failed under the old
  cell limit, is rendered once more the next time it is opened.
- **API contract (breaking):** `@vivd-catalyst/api-contract` no longer exports the constant
  `openApiDocument`; call `createOpenApiDocument()`. `createOpenApiDocumentFromOperations`
  takes the operations alone: title and version are those of the release. An operation that
  answers a file states its content type (`blob("text/html")`), and an operation of a
  signed-in caller may state `scope: null` when it asks for no scope.
- **API (operator-relevant):** every operation is rate limited, against spamming and guessing
  only. A call is counted per operation and per caller: the signed-in person or service where
  the operation authenticates one, the client address where it does not. The defaults are 6000
  calls a minute to a reading operation and 1200 a minute to a changing one. A host backend's
  session-token calls are counted under its server credential, 6000 a minute. A caller over a
  limit receives 429 with the code `RATE_LIMITED`, `details.retryAfterSeconds` and a
  `Retry-After` header; the chat interface waits that long and sends an upload again. The new
  release config section `rateLimits` sets `enabled`, `readPerMinute`, `writePerMinute`,
  `signInPerAccountPerMinute` and `signInPerAddressPerMinute`; an instance without the section
  gets the defaults. The counters live in the API process: they start empty after a restart,
  and an instance must run one API process. The client address is taken from
  `X-Forwarded-For` only when the direct peer is a loopback or private address, so the reverse
  proxy in front of the API has to pass the real client address on. Where Caddy sits behind
  another proxy, its Caddyfile needs `servers { trusted_proxies static private_ranges }`, or
  every caller is counted as one address.
- **Sign-in (operator-relevant):** sign-in and password reset are limited to
  10 tries a minute on one account from one client address, and 300 a minute from one address
  whatever the account, so an office behind one address is not locked out by one person. A
  refused API key or server credential is counted per address, 60 a minute, on a counter the
  accepted credential never touches. The sign-in routes under `/api/auth/*` are counted by the
  API before a password is checked and answer with the same 429 as every operation. Until now
  their limit depended on `NODE_ENV=production`, which the reference Compose files do not
  set, so it was off. Reset mails for requests from one client address are capped at 200 an
  hour, up from 20; the cap of three an hour per mailbox stays.
- **Server runtime (breaking):** `createChatServer`, `ClientInstanceApp` and the document
  worker expose `{ fetch(request), listen, close }` and no web framework type.
  `ClientInstanceApp.server` and the worker's `server` are gone: call `app.fetch(new
Request(url))` where code called `app.server.inject(...)`. `listen` resolves with the base
  URL. `createRoute` and `Route` are no longer exported from `@vivd-catalyst/chat-server`.
  The object `createStandaloneAuthRuntime` returns has `routeKind(pathname)`, which the server
  uses to count calls to the sign-in routes.
- **Platform store (breaking):** Postgres is the only platform store. The `STORE` environment
  variable is no longer read, so `STORE=memory` no longer starts an instance without a
  database; every process needs `DATABASE_URL`. Remove `STORE` from environment files. The
  `storeMode` option is gone from `createClientInstanceApp`, the worker factories, `listen` and
  the capability context, together with the `PlatformStoreMode` type, and an artifact preview
  `sourceReaderFactory` no longer receives `storeMode`. `@vivd-catalyst/core/testing` and its
  `InMemoryPlatformStore` are removed.
- **Workspaces (breaking):** workspaces are part of every instance, and the switch
  `ui.collaborationWorkspaces.enabled` is removed. Every signed-in user of the interface sees
  the workspace selector at the top of the rail, with the client branding inside it; an
  embedded token session keeps its fixed context and the branding head. Remove
  `ui.collaborationWorkspaces` from config files. For this one release a config that still
  says `enabled: true` loads; `enabled: false`, or any other value, stops the instance at
  startup with a message that names the key. That acceptance ends with the next release. The
  safe config (`GET /api/v1/instance/config`) no longer carries `features.collaborationWorkspaces`:
  deploy the interface and the API together, because an interface built before this release
  reads the new answer as invalid. Creating, browsing and requesting access to a Shared
  Workspace and adding members no longer answer 403 "Collaboration workspaces are not enabled
  for this instance".
- **Views (breaking):** a generated view loads Tailwind CSS and Lucide from the instance, in
  pinned versions under `/app-runtime/view/1/`, and no longer from two public hosts. A reverse
  proxy in front of an instance must route `/app-runtime/*` to the API. The hosts a view may
  load other scripts from are the instance key `views.allowedScriptSrc`, which defaults to
  none; before, the `show_view` tool's `config.allowedScriptSrc` defaulted to every HTTPS
  host. The `show_view` tool takes no config now: any key left there fails validation and
  names the new key. The interface composes a view's head and content policy when it shows
  the view, so the setting also governs views saved earlier: before upgrading, name every
  host saved views still need.
- **Breaking, operations:** migrations run only as an explicit step, and `RUN_MIGRATIONS` is
  gone. Each client builds `dist/migrate.js` (`client.migrate()` in `src/migrate.ts`); the
  Compose `migrate` service runs `node <client folder>/dist/migrate.js` and the API and workers
  wait for it. The API and the workers no longer migrate when they start: a database that
  lacks committed migrations stops them with the missing migration names, and a database
  ahead of the release starts. Remove `RUN_MIGRATIONS` from Compose and environment files and
  replace an inline migration command with the entry; a setup that relied on the API
  migrating at startup must run the step first. `@vivd-catalyst/postgres-store` exports
  `migrateDatabase({ databaseUrl })`, which holds the advisory lock and returns the applied
  names; the `runMigrations` option and the store's `migrate()` are removed.
- **Operations:** schema changes follow expand and contract. `pnpm check:migrations` rejects
  a changed, removed or renamed committed migration and lints every migration the base branch
  lacks against an allow list of additive forms. Any other statement, such as a drop, a
  rename, a type change, `DELETE` or a `DO` block, passes only under
  `-- contract-after: <tag>` once the oldest supported release in
  `packages/postgres-store/migration-policy.json` reached that tag; a required column without
  a default and a blocking index build never pass. A concurrent index build goes in a
  migration of its own and runs outside a transaction. `pnpm test:compatibility` runs the
  database tests of the previous and the oldest supported release against the new schema, and
  `pnpm test:upgrade` migrates a database of the oldest supported release.
- **API (breaking):** every product operation is under `/api/v1`, and no old path answers any
  more. An old path returns 404 `NOT_FOUND` "Operation is not available" with
  `details.reason: "unknown_operation"`; the one exception is the old API-key exchange below.
  A caller changes the path of every request. `/api/conversations…`
  becomes `/api/v1/conversations…`, `/api/collaboration-workspaces…` becomes
  `/api/v1/workspaces…`, `/api/approval-requests…` becomes `/api/v1/approval-requests…`,
  `/api/me…` becomes `/api/v1/me…`, and `/api/password-reset` and `/api/password-setup` gain the
  prefix. Paths carry no role name: `/api/admin/config/…` becomes `/api/v1/instance/config/…`,
  `/api/admin/collaboration-workspaces` becomes `/api/v1/instance/workspaces`,
  `/api/superadmin/users…` becomes `/api/v1/instance/users…`, `/api/superadmin/usage` becomes
  `/api/v1/instance/usage`, `/api/superadmin/api-access/service-principals…` becomes
  `/api/v1/instance/service-principals…`, `/api/superadmin/api-access/credentials/:id/revoke`
  becomes `/api/v1/instance/api-credentials/:id/revoke`, `/api/audit-events` and
  `/api/audit-activities` move to `/api/v1/instance/…`, and `/api/config` and `/api/branding`
  become `/api/v1/instance/config` and `/api/v1/instance/branding`. Rights are unchanged.
  `/health` stays public and unversioned, and `/api/auth/*` stays the sign-in library's mount.
  A reverse proxy that forwards `/api/*` needs no change.
- **Interface:** reload every open tab after the upgrade. A tab loaded before it calls the old
  paths and shows "Operation is not available" with no hint; this release cannot change that
  page. From this release on, the interface shows one notice with a reload action when the
  server answers that it does not know an operation the interface called.
- **API (breaking):** the API-key exchange moved from `POST /api/auth/access-token` to
  `POST /api/v1/auth/access-token`. Session-token issuance for embedding hosts moved from
  `POST /api/superadmin/session-tokens` to `POST /api/v1/instance/session-tokens`, and its
  alias `POST /auth/session-token` is removed. An older CLI, which sends its key as a bearer
  to the old exchange path, reads 401 `UNAUTHENTICATED` "Standalone auth endpoints do not
  accept explicit credential headers" on an instance with standalone sign-in, because the
  sign-in mount refuses the header before it routes, and 404 elsewhere. A backend that issues chat session tokens
  changes its URL; the `x-server-credential` header and the payload are unchanged. Before this
  release is deployed, search the production access log for both old token paths and move any
  caller found.
- **API (breaking):** operation ids are `<resource>.<verb>`, for example `conversations.list`,
  `workspaces.members.add` and `me.get`, in the OpenAPI document and in `apiOperations`. Code
  that read `apiOperations.listConversations` reads `apiOperations["conversations.list"]`.
  The development mail listing moved to `GET /api/v1/dev/captured-mail` and stays out of the
  document, as does `/health`.
- **CLI (breaking):** `catalyst config` signs in with `CATALYST_API_KEY` only. The fallback to
  `CATALYST_SERVER_CREDENTIAL` and `CHAT_SERVER_CREDENTIAL` and its deprecation warning are
  removed; without a key the CLI stops before it sends a request. Create a service principal
  and a key under Administration → API Access and set `CATALYST_API_KEY` wherever the CLI runs.
  The server needs `SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` set, at least 32 characters; without it the
  instance has no API access and the CLI cannot sign in. For a local development instance,
  `catalyst config local-key` creates the principal and key as the seeded superadmin and
  writes the key into `.env`; it refuses any other host. CLI and server ship together: this
  CLI needs a server that answers under `/api/v1`.
- **Client:** `getAuthSession`, `signInWithEmail` and `signOut` are exported from
  `@vivd-catalyst/api-client`; the interface no longer fetches `/api/auth/*` itself.
- **Client (breaking):** the methods of `createApiClient` are derived from the operation
  catalog instead of written by hand or generated. Every operation is one method under the
  segments of its id, and takes one object with the parts its descriptor names:
  `client.conversations.thread.get({ params: { conversationId } })`,
  `client.conversations.list({ query: { collaborationWorkspaceId } })`,
  `client.users.create({ body })`, each with an optional `signal`. The old names are gone, for
  example `client.account.get()` is `client.me.get()`, `client.runs.start(id, input)` is
  `client.conversations.runs.start({ params, body })` and `client.configAssets.export()` is
  `client.config_assets.export()`. A list method answers one page, `{ items, nextCursor }`;
  `listAll((paging) => client.users.list({ query: paging }))` reads a list to its end. A
  stream is an async iterable, resumed with `query: { after }`. A file URL for the browser
  comes from `client.urlFor(operationId, { params, query })`. A success that is not valid JSON
  or does not match the response schema is now an `ApiError` with the response status and the
  parse failure as `payload`, where a schema mismatch was a `ZodError` before; an abort
  through the caller's `signal` rejects with the abort itself, never an `ApiError`; a stream
  that breaks off is an `ApiError` of status 0. The package no longer contains generated code
  and no longer depends on `@hey-api/openapi-ts`; its `generate` script is removed. The
  OpenAPI document of `@vivd-catalyst/api-contract` is unchanged.
- **API (breaking):** every list answers with `{ items, nextCursor }` instead of a bare array.
  `limit` defaults to 50 and accepts 1 to 200, anything else answers 422. `nextCursor` is
  absent on the last page; pass it back as `cursor` with the same filters to read the next
  page. A cursor from another list or with other filters answers 422. The conversation
  resources list carries `items` instead of `resources`, and the agents of a workspace carry
  `items` instead of `agents`, next to `defaultAgentName`. Workspaces in the directory and in
  the administration picker carry `createdAt`, the key they are paged by. The audit
  activity view is not paged: it answers `{ items }` with the latest activities only, at most
  100 from the latest 500 audit events, and takes no `limit` or `cursor`. The shared API
  client keeps returning complete arrays; its audit event helper returns the latest 100
  events.
- **API (breaking):** every timestamp is UTC and ends in `Z`. A timestamp with an offset such
  as `+02:00`, or without a zone, answers 422; this applies to `expiresAt` when an API
  credential is created.
- **API (breaking):** reading no longer creates anything. A list of workspaces or
  conversations does not create the caller's Personal Workspace; call
  `POST /api/v1/workspaces/personal` once instead. A preview read does not start
  the preview; call `POST /api/v1/conversations/{conversationId}/artifacts/{artifactId}/preview`
  or `POST /api/v1/conversations/{conversationId}/attachments/{attachmentId}/preview`, and read
  the preview until it is ready. A preview that was never started reads as `pending` without
  `queuedAt`. The three operations need the scope of the read they replace.
- **API (breaking):** every error answers with
  `{ error: { code, message, correlationId, details? } }`, and the same id in the
  `x-correlation-id` response header. A caller's own `x-correlation-id` request header is
  kept. An unknown path answers 404 in this shape. `RATE_LIMITED` (429) is a new code. An
  `INTERNAL` error always reads "Internal server error".
- **Document worker (breaking):** the worker answers errors in the same envelope,
  `{ error: { code, message, correlationId } }`, instead of the flat `{ code, message }`.
  Deploy the worker and the application of one release together.
- **Chat:** after a restart, an instance that runs agents in its own process ends the runs the
  last process left open, so their conversations accept new messages at once.
- **Chat:** the conversation list is a compact single-line list without the last-updated date.
  A conversation within seven days of its retention date carries an amber clock, on instances
  with `retention.expireConversations` enabled. Its hint names the deletion date; it opens on
  hover and on keyboard focus, and the row's menu repeats it for touch.
- **Administration:** saving an agent or skill confirms it next to the save button until the
  form is edited again.
- **Chat:** the start page introduces the agent with its icon and name, centred above the
  composer: several agents make the name a picker that opens on click, a single agent a plain
  label. In a conversation the header shows the icon alone, and pointing at it opens the agent
  list, with a single agent too. `ui.showAgentName` is now `true` by default, decides
  only whether the start page shows the name beside the icon, and no longer adds the client
  name beneath the agent; with `ui.showAgentName: false` the start page shows the icon alone
  as well.
- **Chat:** the agent list shows each agent's description only with the new
  `ui.showAgentDescriptions: true`; by default it lists the names alone.

### Fixed

- **Retention:** conversation expiry decides under the conversation's row lock and removes
  data only afterwards. A conversation is expired only if it is still due, or still an
  abandoned draft, at that moment, so a message, an upload or a restored draft attachment that
  arrives while the job runs keeps the conversation and its files. A due conversation with an
  agent run in progress is left for the next run of the job. Deleting a conversation follows
  the same order. When removing stored objects fails, the conversation stays expired or
  deleted, the failure is audited as `conversation.cleanup_failed`, and the retention job
  retries the cleanup on each run and audits `conversation.cleanup_completed` when it is done.
  `conversation.retention_expired` and `conversation.deleted` carry `cleanup: "complete"` or
  `"pending"`. The first retention run after the update also cleans what earlier deleted or
  expired conversations left behind when their cleanup had failed.
- **Workspaces, accounts:** deleting a Shared Workspace, an account or a user answers 409 with
  `details.pendingCleanupCount` while data of its deleted conversations is still being
  removed, and removes nothing further. The conversations are deleted at that point. The
  request completes when it is repeated after the retention job has finished the cleanup. A
  refused account deletion leaves the user with every membership and access request. The
  refusal is audited as `collaboration_workspace.delete_failed` or `user.delete_failed`. The
  retention job now retries pending cleanups before it expires conversations. When only
  execution workspace data of a deleted conversation is left, the workspace cleanup job
  finishes it, not the retention job. No time is promised for the repeat: it succeeds once
  the jobs have run and found nothing left. Both deletions take the workspace row lock first,
  so a conversation that is created in the workspace or moved into it at the same moment
  fails instead of being removed with it.
- **Conversations:** an artifact, a workspace file or a message is written only into an active
  conversation and under the conversation's row lock. A write that arrives after the
  conversation was deleted or expired is refused with `NOT_FOUND`; the writer removes the
  bytes it had already stored, best effort, and logs a failed removal with the object key. An
  agent run or a workspace command that is still working when its conversation is deleted
  fails at its next such write.
- **Attachments:** in an instance without a capability attachment handler, deleting a
  conversation now removes every object its records name, preview images under
  `artifact-previews/` included. Before, those images stayed in storage while their records
  were marked deleted. Images left behind by earlier versions are not removed by this
  release.
- **Audit:** `conversation.cleanup_failed` and `conversation.cleanup_completed` appear in the
  governance tier, and the four new event types have labels in the activity view.

## 0.6.3 — 2026-10-08

### Fixed

- **Chat:** a file is read before its upload request opens, and an upload that fails without an
  answer from the API is retried. A browser that could not read a file promptly used to stall
  the request until the reverse proxy gave up. The remaining error names the file.
- **Models:** a provider `server_error` or `rate_limit_exceeded` inside a Responses stream is
  retried like the same failure on the request. A stream that stays silent for 10 minutes is
  given up as a timeout instead of holding the run until the provider answers.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-10-08

### Changed

- **Chat:** a long user message is collapsed to a few lines with "Show more" and "Show less".

## 0.6.1 — 2026-10-08

### Changed

- **Skill change proposals:** a proposal for a new skill can carry its supporting files in the
  same request: `create_skill` first, followed by `create_resource` operations such as
  `references/checklist.md`. The limit per operation text is 20,000 characters instead of 4,000.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-06

### Added

- **Deployment kit:** the release and deploy tooling of operated instances is the package
  `@vivd-catalyst/deployment-kit` with the command `catalyst-deploy` (`check`, `update-refs`,
  `prepare-workspace`, `publish`, `manifest`, `deploy`). It carries what each deployment repo
  kept as its own copy: the deploy by image digest, release manifests, staging and production
  publishing, Postgres backup and restore with their systemd units, the zram setup, and the
  checks of the worker wiring in Compose. A deployment names its instance in
  `deploy/deployment.env` (`INSTANCE`, `IMAGE_REPOSITORY`, `APP_PACKAGE`,
  `EXECUTION_WORKSPACES`); host paths, dump names and unit names follow from it. The package is
  not published yet and is used from the platform checkout at the pinned ref.

### Changed

- **Deployment kit:** the scripts under `scripts/deployment-kit/` moved into the package. The
  old paths remain as forwarding stubs, so deployments pinned to them keep working.
- **Release check:** `check-release.sh` no longer requires a `deploy/scripts` directory in the
  deployment.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-10-06

### Added

- **Retention:** the hourly retention job removes orphaned managed files. A `managed_files` row
  older than 24 hours that no active conversation refers to, through an attachment of any
  status or as the source of an artifact, is marked deleted and its stored object is removed.
  This reaches what user deletions before 2026-08-31 and interrupted uploads left behind. The
  job records one `storage.orphaned_files_deleted` audit event with counts per run that removed
  something. An attachment handler takes part by implementing the optional
  `deleteOrphanedFileObjects`; without it nothing is removed.

### Fixed

- **Admin pages:** a table taller than the window, such as the user list, scrolls again instead
  of being cut off.
- **show_view:** the layout guidance for views closes two padding loopholes.
- **Conversation rail:** the collapse handle on the rail's edge no longer covers the list's
  scrollbar. It appears while the pointer is on the rail's right border or the handle has
  keyboard focus.
- **Uploads into a deleted conversation:** a draft attachment whose conversation is deleted
  while the file is still arriving is rejected before any bytes are stored. The conversation
  was checked only when the request started, so a slow upload could leave a stored object and
  a `managed_files` row that no deletion would reach.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-06

### Added

- **Retention:** `retention.expireConversations: false` lets a client instance keep
  conversations indefinitely.

### Changed

- **Packaging:** the library packages carry publish metadata for npm (`files`, typed `exports`
  without the `development` condition, restricted access, licence, `engines`) and are no longer
  marked `private`. `pnpm release:check` builds, packs and inspects every tarball and installs a
  consumer set outside the workspace; `pnpm release:metadata` reapplies the shared fields.
  Nothing is published yet.
- **chat-ui:** `tailwindcss` and `tw-animate-css` are peer dependencies. The stylesheet no longer
  scans `chat-standalone`, which has its own stylesheet now, and finds Streamdown's classes when
  installed from a tarball as well as in the workspace.

### Fixed

- **Abandoned draft conversations:** attaching files on the start page and removing them again
  no longer leaves an empty conversation in the rail. `GET /api/conversations` lists a
  conversation without messages only to its creator, and only while it holds draft attachments;
  access by id is unchanged. Removing the last draft attachment returns the composer to the
  start page, and the retention job expires conversations that have had neither messages nor
  draft attachments for 24 hours. This cleanup also runs with
  `retention.expireConversations: false`, which keeps every conversation that has a message or
  a draft attachment.
- The `catalyst` CLI did nothing when started through the `node_modules/.bin` link of an
  installed package.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-06

### Changed

- **Agent model settings:** an agent may offer its users any model binding agents may use. The
  binding-level `userSelectable` key in release config is still accepted but no longer has an
  effect; `agent_models.manage` governs the choice. The agent editor shows one model list with
  a default and a "Selectable by users" tick per model.
- **Reasoning effort per model:** `modelReasoningEfforts` sets the effort for each model an
  agent offers to users, edited per row in the model list. `reasoningEffort` stays the effort
  of the agent's own model and is no longer applied to a model a user picked instead, which
  now runs with its own entry or the binding's default.
- **API:** the safe config view no longer carries the top-level `selectableModels`; use
  `agents[].selectableModels`. The config assets overview no longer carries
  `references.userSelectableModelBindings`.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-06

### Changed

- **Agent model settings:** each agent lists the models chat users may pick in
  `userSelectableModelBindingIds`, editable with `agent_models.manage`. The composer offers the
  agent's own model plus that list instead of every `userSelectable` binding, so a deployment
  that offered a model choice must add the list to its agents to keep it. The safe config view
  carries `agents[].selectableModels`.

### Fixed

- Saving an agent's model settings no longer fails with 403 when its other fields are locked:
  unchanged fields were reported as changed because stored JSON key order differs.
- A rejected save shows the server's message next to the save button.
- Viewers of a shared conversation can no longer interrupt another user's active run.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-06

First versioned release. Compared with production, which runs `staging-2026.09.14-1` (platform
`a2a13a8`, deployed 2026-09-14):

### Added

- **Email:** transactional mail with password reset and user invitations.
- **Approvals:** agents propose skill changes; reviewers approve, reject or request changes on an
  approvals page with an open queue and a collapsed history. Decisions appear in the conversation.
  Release-configured checks fail closed. A reviewer revises someone else's proposal in their own
  conversation.
- **Conversation visibility:** private conversations in Shared Workspaces, with a default per
  workspace.
- **Agent availability:** agents can be limited to selected Collaboration Workspaces.
- **Start page:** centred composer with starter prompts and agent cards.
- **Agent model settings:** model, reasoning effort and fast mode per agent behind the
  `agent_models.manage` permission; fast runs are settled by the tier the provider reports.
- **Operations:** the agent-run worker drains active runs on shutdown; the config CLI detects
  conflicts per asset and lists agents left hidden after a push.

### Fixed

- Workspace conversations stay in the rail on settings, approvals and admin pages.
- User messages with wide code blocks stay inside the thread; code and quotes are readable in
  user message bubbles.
- Forwarding headers are trusted from private proxy peers.
- Emailed password setup completes in one transaction and rejects invalid tokens early.
