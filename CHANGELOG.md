# Changelog

All platform packages are released in lockstep under one version. Before 1.0 a minor version may
contain breaking changes; a patch version does not.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- **Agent model settings:** each agent lists the models chat users may pick in
  `userSelectableModelBindingIds`, editable with `agent_models.manage`. The composer offers the
  agent's own model plus that list instead of every `userSelectable` binding, so a deployment
  that offered a model choice must add the list to its agents to keep it. The safe config view
  carries `agents[].selectableModels`.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-06

First versioned release. Compared with the production release of 2026-09-07:

### Added

- **Email:** transactional mail with password reset and user invitations.
- **Approvals:** agents propose skill changes; reviewers approve, reject or request changes on an
  approvals page with an open queue and a collapsed history. Decisions appear in the conversation.
  Release-configured checks fail closed. A reviewer revises someone else's proposal in their own
  conversation.
- **Conversation visibility:** private conversations in Shared Workspaces, with a default per
  workspace.
- **Agent availability:** agents can be limited to selected Collaboration Workspaces.
- **Start page:** centred composer with starter prompts and agent cards.
- **Agent model settings:** model, reasoning effort and fast mode per agent behind the
  `agent_models.manage` permission; fast runs are settled by the tier the provider reports.
- **Operations:** the agent-run worker drains active runs on shutdown; the config CLI detects
  conflicts per asset and lists agents left hidden after a push.

### Fixed

- Workspace conversations stay in the rail on settings, approvals and admin pages.
- User messages with wide code blocks stay inside the thread; code and quotes are readable in
  user message bubbles.
- Forwarding headers are trusted from private proxy peers.
- Emailed password setup completes in one transaction and rejects invalid tokens early.

### Database
