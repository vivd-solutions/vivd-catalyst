# Changelog

All platform packages are released in lockstep under one version. Before 1.0 a minor version may
contain breaking changes; a patch version does not.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Access:** an instance administrator can give one user read, write or delete on agents or
  skills inside a Namespace or on one asset, and can deny it. A Namespace is a registered name
  prefix such as `kai-`; it can carry a list of allowed tools and a list of allowed model
  bindings, which bind every writer of an agent in it, an administrator and the release sync
  included. Eight operations under `/api/v1/instance/access` write and read grants and Namespaces;
  they need `users.manage`. A deny wins over every grant and role that would allow the same action
  on that asset. It does not wall the asset off from holders of instance rights: export and
  setting the default agent are decided at the instance and still reach it. A holder who is denied
  anything on an asset cannot delete it. Deleting an asset removes the allow rows on it and keeps
  the deny rows: a deny on a name stays until it is revoked, also across delete and recreate, and
  the grant list keeps showing it. In a Namespace with a list of model bindings, a user who may
  write agents there sets `modelBindingId` to a binding on the list without holding
  `agent_models.manage`; a binding off the list is refused for everyone, and an agent that names a
  provider or no model is refused unless the writer holds `agent_models.manage`. A grant's
  `grantedBy` and a Namespace's `createdBy` are left out for a caller who is not shown that user.
  Deleting a user deletes the user's grant rows. No interface for it ships yet. A migration adds
  the tables `permission_grants` and `namespaces` and changes no other table; no user, service
  principal or API key gains or loses a right. `node --experimental-strip-types
scripts/verify-permissions.ts` with `DATABASE_URL` set compares every holder's rights with what
  the legacy columns answered and exits non-zero on a difference. Before rolling back to an
  earlier release, list the deny rows (`select * from permission_grants where effect = 'deny'`):
  an earlier release reads neither table, so every grant stops applying and every deny stops
  refusing. An earlier release that deletes an agent or skill leaves the grant rows on it, and
  they apply again if the same name is created after rolling forward. Remove them first: `delete
from permission_grants where scope_kind = 'asset' and effect = 'allow' and scope_id in (select
id from config_assets where status = 'deleted')`.
- **Operations:** an operation can be registered once in the operation registry and is then
  reached through one call path, `runOperation`, that checks the actor's right, resolves the
  policy, asks the guardrails, executes and records the call as an Operation Run. Over HTTP
  the status says how the run went: `200` with the output, `202` with the run and a
  `Location` header while it waits for an approval, `403` for a refusal (`FORBIDDEN`,
  `POLICY_DENIED`, `GUARDRAIL_BLOCKED`, `DECLINED`), the operation's own error for a failure.
  Every answer of such a call names its run in the header `Operation-Run-Id`. A changing
  operation takes an `Idempotency-Key`, scoped to its caller: the same call again is answered
  from the run with `Idempotent-Replayed: true`, and `409` tells a key used for another call
  (`IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`), a first call still running (`OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS`), an
  expired one (`OPERATION_EXPIRED`) or an answer too large to keep (`OUTPUT_NOT_RETAINED`).
  A changing call that failed is never run again under its key, since it may have changed
  something before it failed: the key answers the recorded failure again, with the same
  status and code and `Idempotent-Replayed: true`, and another attempt takes a new key. Only
  a call that failed before its operation was reached runs again under its key. A changing
  call that was interrupted answers `409 OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS` with
  `details.interrupted: true`, because nobody knows how far it got. A replay answers the
  actor that holds the key without asking for the right again: the actor had it when the
  call ran, and a refusal would hide an outcome that happened. The origin of a run over HTTP
  follows how the call was authenticated: a browser session is `user`, a key or token in the
  request is `cli`, also for a person's token. An operation that requires no right must be
  registered with an `authorize` function, which is asked where a named right is: after the
  scope and before the policy, the guardrails and an approval. Without one the server does
  not start.
  No operation of the release is registered this way yet. A run stores a hash of the input,
  never the input, and for a failure a code and a safe message.
- **Operations:** `GET /api/v1/operations/runs/{runId}` reads one Operation Run and
  `GET /api/v1/operations/runs` lists them, filtered by operation, status, actor, origin,
  workspace and time. A caller reads its own run; any other run and the list take the right
  to view the audit log. Both take the scope `governance:read`.
- **Release config:** `policy.defaults` sets the policy value of operations that nothing else
  names one for: `reading` is `allow` or `deny` (default `allow`), `changing` is `allow`,
  `confirm`, `approval` or `deny` (default `confirm`). An instance without the section gets
  the defaults.
- **Database:** migration `0033_operation_runs` adds the table `operation_runs` and the
  nullable columns `user_id`, `collaboration_workspace_id` and `operation_run_id` on
  `model_usage_events`. Nothing writes the three columns yet. The previous release runs
  against the migrated database.
- **API client:** a method of an operation that can wait for an approval answers an
  `OperationOutcome`: `done` with the output or `pending_approval` with the run. The client
  sends a new `Idempotency-Key` with every such call unless the caller passes
  `idempotencyKey`. `createApiClientFor(operations, options)` builds the same client for
  operations outside the release's catalog. Cross-origin browsers may send `Idempotency-Key`
  and read `Operation-Run-Id`, `Idempotent-Replayed` and `Location`.
- **API contract:** `defineRegisteredOperation` defines an operation of the registry.
  `defineOperation` takes an optional second success answer (`accepted`) and declared
  `headers`, which the OpenAPI document states. Error codes that share a status share one
  answer in the document, named after all of them.

- **API:** `GET /api/v1/conversations` takes an optional `query`. It keeps the conversations
  whose title contains the text, without regard to case, with the paging and the access
  filter of the list.
- **API reference:** an instance serves the OpenAPI document of the operations it runs at
  `GET /api/v1/openapi.json` and the same document as a page at `GET /api/v1/docs`. Both
  answer any signed-in person and any access token, whatever its scopes, and refuse a caller
  without a credential. The page holds no script and loads nothing from another host. The
  docs site has an "API Reference" section written from the release's document at build time.
- **API contract:** `openapi.json` is an OpenAPI 3.1 document with the release version, named
  schemas, the credentials each operation accepts with the scope it needs, an answer for every
  error code, `text/event-stream` and 204 for a stream, and the effect, rights and rate class
  of each operation as `x-catalyst-*` fields. It ships in `@vivd-catalyst/api-contract` as
  `@vivd-catalyst/api-contract/openapi.json`. `pnpm generate:openapi` writes it;
  `pnpm check:openapi` fails when it is stale or has a lint finding; `pnpm check:contract`
  fails on a change that breaks a caller of the newest release whose document has `/api/v1`
  paths, and passes with a notice while no such release exists. Both run in `pnpm check`.
  The package also exports `findBreakingChanges`, `describeApiReference` and
  `renderApiReferencePage`.

- **Chat:** the composer's model selector is a model picker. It opens as a short menu with the
  model and its reasoning effort; the model list shows each model's provider logo and an EU
  mark for providers with `region: eu`, and a model under the pointer brings up a
  card with its description and usage consumption. A model binding can carry `description`,
  `vendor` and `usageTier` for it. The usage tier comes from the Customer Rate Card unless the
  binding sets one.
- **Chat:** users can pick the reasoning effort of a model: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`
  or `max` unless the binding's `userSelectableReasoningEfforts` lists others, and an empty
  list turns the choice off. `max` is a new reasoning effort, also available in agent model
  settings. The agent's configured effort stays the default. The run
  API accepts `reasoningEffort` and rejects an effort the model that runs does not offer. A
  migration adds `agent_runs.reasoning_effort`.
- **Chat:** a model or reasoning effort the user picks becomes their default for new
  conversations, on every device. A conversation that already ran stays on what its latest run
  used, and a user who never picked anything follows the configured defaults. The pick is
  stored per user (`/api/v1/me/model-preference`); a migration adds `product_users.model_preference`.
- **Workspaces:** a superadmin is Owner of every Shared Workspace without being a member. The
  workspace selector lists them under "Other workspaces"; the superadmin can open their
  settings, manage members and access requests, and read and start conversations there.
  Private conversations stay with their author and Personal Workspaces with their user. A
  workspace in the API carries `membershipRole` (`null` without a membership) next to `role`,
  which is what the caller may do.

### Changed

- **Config assets:** the overview lists the `id` of each agent and skill.
- **Rights:** every rights check of the API and of tool calls is answered by one evaluator,
  `evaluateAccess` in `@vivd-catalyst/core`. `InProcessToolExecution` takes an optional
  `authorizer`; `ChatServerOptions.stores` needs the `access` store, which
  `createPostgresStores` provides.
- **Deleting an account or a Shared Workspace:** a deletion now finishes by itself. The
  request closes the account or the workspace at once: the user can no longer sign in and is
  listed as "Being deleted", the workspace is gone from every selector and its conversations
  accept nothing. When stored data cannot be removed at once, the request answers `202`
  without a body instead of `409`, and a job (`account.delete`, `workspace.delete`) tries
  again with a growing wait, up to 50 times over about ten days. When nothing is left to wait
  for, the request answers `200` as before. A repeated request answers `202` and starts
  nothing new. After the last attempt the job is dead, the audit log holds
  `user.deletion_stalled` or `collaboration_workspace.deletion_stalled`, the account or
  workspace stays closed, and deleting it again starts a new job. The dead job is kept until
  the account or workspace is gone, also past the 30 days other dead jobs are kept. A closed
  account leaves its Shared Workspaces and access requests with the first pass. Of two owners
  who delete their accounts at the same moment, the second is refused as the last owner; the
  same holds for a deletion and a role change or removal at the same moment. The first pass
  asks the agent runs of the user or in the workspace to stop, and a run still working stores
  no further message: every write into a conversation of a closed account or workspace is
  refused, whichever runtime the instance uses. The account or the workspace is removed only
  when these runs have ended and the stored data of every conversation the user created is
  gone. That includes execution workspace data on an instance that has the feature off: rows
  without stored objects are cleared, and stored objects that cannot be removed fail the
  attempt. An attempt that removes nothing fails, so a deletion that cannot go on ends as a
  dead job with its `deletion_stalled` event. An administrator who changes a user being
  deleted, or writes a grant for one, gets `409 CONFLICT`, and such a user holds no rights.
  The grant and deny rows a user holds go with the user; rows the user wrote for others and
  Namespaces the user registered stay and keep the user's id. The audit log records
  `user.deletion_requested` and `collaboration_workspace.deletion_requested` when a deletion
  is accepted; `user.delete_failed` and `collaboration_workspace.delete_failed` are no longer
  written. A client that calls one of the three delete operations must accept `202`. Upgrade:
  migration `0035_deletion_requested` adds a nullable column to two tables. Rollback: the
  previous release does not know the mark, so a closed account could sign in again and a
  closed workspace would be listed again. Let the deletion jobs finish before rolling back.
  These two queries list what is still closed, and both must return nothing:
  `select id from product_users where deletion_requested_at is not null` and
  `select id from collaboration_workspaces where deletion_requested_at is not null`.
- **API:** a call refused for a missing right answers `403 FORBIDDEN` with the message
  `Missing the right '<action>'` and `details.action` and `details.reason`, on every route.
  The message was `Missing permission '<permission>'` and named the legacy permission. The
  routes ask the server's authorizer, a new server option `authorizer` whose default is the
  rights evaluator over the instance's access store. `details.reason` is `no_grant`,
  `denied`, `holder_inactive` or `unknown_action`.
  routes ask the server's authorizer, a new server option `authorizer` whose default decides
  as before.
- **Logs:** the log record of a failed job keeps the class and the code of its error with the
  job id and kind, and no longer the error with its message and stack. The job row keeps the
  error code and message it kept before.
- **Logs:** the log record of a failed tool handler or operation keeps of a database error
  its SQLSTATE code, constraint and table and no longer its message, which can quote
  rejected values.
- **Interface, Settings:** the Settings dialog, the workspace settings dialog and the
  administration panel are one Settings area with a rail of pages in three groups: You (Profile,
  Language and appearance, Security), Workspace (General, Members, with the shared workspace
  they change named under the group) and Instance (Users, API access, Usage, Audit). A user
  sees only the groups and pages they may open; the server still decides every right. Config
  is the area Build in the main rail and keeps `/admin/config`. Pages live at
  `/settings/<group>/<page>`; `/settings`, `/admin`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/usage`,
  `/admin/audit` and `/admin/api-access` lead to the new addresses. The theme choice gains
  "System". **Breaking for a host that assembles the shell:** the option `adminPanel` of
  `renderStandaloneChatApp` and `ChatShell` is `administration`, and
  `@vivd-catalyst/chat-ui/admin` exports `administration` in place of `superadminPanel` and
  `SuperadminPanel`; pass `administration` from that entry. The type `ChatShellAdminPanel` is
  `ChatShellAdministration`, and `canViewSuperadminPanel` is gone (use
  `canViewAdministrationPanel`).
- **Model calls:** an agent run reaches its model through one model gateway. The gateway
  resolves the model binding, checks what the provider's adapter declares it can do, admits the
  call, retries it and records its usage. Three things change for an operator. Every admitted
  call leaves one usage event, also one that failed, was stopped or timed out; that event has
  no tokens and no cost and counts towards `modelCallsPerDay`. A provider's error is logged
  once as `model_provider.error` with its kind, status, code, request id and the provider's
  message cut to 300 characters on one line; the message is in no error a user or an API
  caller receives. A call that asks an entry for something its adapter does not declare fails
  with a validation error before the provider is called.
- **Breaking, extension API:** a provider on the `models` port returns a `ModelAdapterFactory`
  whose adapter has `capabilities(model)`, `complete` and `stream` and throws
  `ModelProviderError`; `ModelProvider`, `ModelProviderFactory` and
  `ModelProviderRegistry` are gone. `LocalAgentRuntime` takes `modelGateway` in place of
  `modelProvider` and `usageGovernance`. `ModelUsageEventInput` carries an `attribution` in
  place of `conversationId`, `agentRunId` and `agentName`, and `runModelCall` takes the call's
  instance and attribution.
- **Breaking, release config:** `webAccess.search.mode` and `webAccess.search.managedProvider`
  are removed. Delete both before the upgrade; `webAccess.search.enabled` is the only switch.
  A config that still sets one does not start and says: "Client instance config is invalid:
  webAccess.search: 'webAccess.search.mode' was removed: whether a model can search the web is
  declared by its provider, and 'webAccess.search.enabled' is the only switch. Delete the key".
  With both keys the one message names both ("'webAccess.search.mode' and
  'webAccess.search.managedProvider' were removed: ... Delete the keys"). Whether a model can
  search is declared by its adapter: an `openai-compatible` entry with `api: responses` can,
  one on `chat_completions` and the `deterministic` provider cannot. Saving an agent that
  lists `web_search` on a model that cannot is refused with "Agent '<name>' references
  web_search but the model of this agent cannot search the web".
- **Usage:** conversation titles and approval checks are model calls through the gateway and
  now appear in usage. Each leaves one record, also when it failed, timed out or was refused
  by the provider, and counts toward the daily call limit and the other limits of the
  instance. Such a record carries the purpose (`conversation_title`, `guardrail_judge`) where
  an agent run's record carries the agent name, names the conversation when one caused the
  call, and names no agent run. No record names a user yet: everything is counted toward the
  instance's limits, and usage per user comes with a later release. A title that a limit
  refuses fails only its job and never a user's message. An approval check that a limit
  refuses blocks under `onFail: block` with the reason "Check '<id>' could not run because
  the model usage limit of this instance is reached. Try again later."; under `onFail: warn`
  the request is stored as not evaluated.
- **Usage:** a title call ends after 60 seconds like an approval check, is recorded once
  without tokens and frees its job slot and its place in admission. The gateway enforces the
  deadline of a call itself, also against a provider that ignores cancellation.
- **Database:** migration `0036_usage_system_calls` drops `NOT NULL` from
  `model_usage_events.conversation_id` and `agent_run_id`; it moves no data. In the API,
  `conversationId` and `agentRunId` of a usage event are optional. **Rollback:** the previous
  release keeps summing usage and admitting calls correctly with such rows, but its Usage
  page fails for as long as a record of a title or an approval check is among the recent
  events it lists.
- **Breaking, extension API:** `ChatServerOptions` takes `modelGateway` in place of
  `modelProvider`; `ApprovalCheckRunner` takes `{ clientInstanceId, config, modelGateway }`;
  `reasoningEffortChoiceForBinding` takes the efforts the model's adapter declares as its
  second argument, and `createSafeConfigView` offers a reasoning effort choice only when it is
  given `reasoningEffortsOfBinding`. `WebAccessSearchModeConfig`,
  `OPENAI_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER_TOOL_ID` and the gateway's `unsettled` door are gone.
- **Retention:** a conversation's deletion date counts from the last message a user sent, no
  longer from its creation: accepting a message moves the date to `retention.conversationDays`
  later, in the transaction that stores the message. Opening, reading, renaming, moving, the
  generated title and background jobs do not move it. `retention.extendOnActivity: false`
  keeps the date set at creation as a fixed maximum age. Check what an instance promised its
  users before upgrading: the default is `true`. A conversation within seven days of its date
  shows one line above the composer with the deletion date. The line and the clock in the list
  cover at most half the retention period, so a new message always clears them; where a message moves the date,
  the line says that a new message keeps the conversation. The safe config answer carries
  `retention.extendOnActivity`, optional for clients of an older API.
- **UI library:** `Banner` has the layout `line`, one quiet sentence without a box whose icon
  alone carries the tone.
- **Interface, navigation:** the rail is 280 px wide and collapses to a strip of icons with one
  visible control; under 768 px it is a drawer the header opens. Its filter field is gone:
  Search in the rail, or ⌘K (Ctrl+K), opens a command palette that offers New chat, the
  conversations of the active workspace, whose titles it searches on the server, and under
  "Go to" the Settings pages the viewer may open and Build. New chat also has ⌘⇧O
  (Ctrl+Shift+O). The account menu in the rail's footer leads to Profile and to Language and
  appearance and holds the theme switch and sign out. The row menu of a conversation shows
  while the pointer or the keyboard is on the row; the retention clock shows all the time.
  Before anything is typed the palette lists the eight most recent conversations. The list shows placeholder
  rows while it loads and a retry when the load failed. A skip link leads past the rail.
- **Interface, surface:** closing a surface returns the focus to what opened it, a surface that
  covers the conversation takes it out of the tab order, and Escape closes a menu or the
  palette before the surface.
- **UI library:** `Sidebar` is one `nav` landmark where it was an `aside` around a `nav`.
  `NavItem` gains `trailing` and `shortcut`, `IconButton` gains `shortcut`. New:
  `CommandPalette`, `SkipLink` and the token `--layout-sidebar-collapsed`.
- **Interface, default theme:** an instance that sets no `ui.theme` or `ui.darkTheme` now shows
  warm paper neutrals with one terracotta accent (light `#fdfbf7` page, `#f6f3ec` sidebar,
  `#b5573a` accent; dark `#1c1a17` page, `#131210` sidebar, `#d98c6c` accent). An instance
  with its own theme keeps its seven colours; the names of the inputs and tokens are
  unchanged. On every instance, buttons and the segmented control are pills and filled buttons
  carry a hairline and a faint edge. The primary and the danger button are tinted instead of
  solid: a soft fill of the accent or of red, its line and its strong text. The send button
  in the composer is filled with the text colour. A hovered ghost button keeps the text
  colour, and an avatar without a colour of its own is a neutral grey with initials in the
  text colour. One derived token is new: `--shadow-control`.
- **Chat:** the display panel is the surface slot. A tool display or a file preview stands
  beside the conversation while both sides keep 380 px, which is from 760 px of main area, and
  covers the main area below that, where its header offers "Show chat" alone. The former drawer
  below 1024 px is gone. The width is free, is remembered in the browser per kind of surface
  and is clamped so neither side falls below 380 px. The handle is the line between the two
  sides: the arrow keys move it 16 px, Home and End go to the limits. Fullscreen shows "Show
  chat" beside its controls. Nothing animates when the surface opens or resizes.
- **Chat UI:** `ToolDisplayPanel` and `ToolDisplayPanelFrame` are replaced by `SurfaceSlot` and
  the library's `SurfaceFrame`. The standalone app builds its routes from one table,
  `chat-ui/src/routes.ts`; every address keeps its path.
- **Limits:** five defaults that failed honest use are raised. A model call is tried three
  times, waiting about 1 s and then about 4 s, so a run survives two provider errors in a row
  (a rate limit waits longer, see Fixed). An approval check may take 60 s (was 10 s); a blocking rule that runs out of time says
  so. A spreadsheet previews up to 50,000 cells per sheet or range (was 5,000), and the stored
  failure names the limit. A preview embedded in a message is read up to 500 pages (was 200),
  the same ceiling the preview worker uses, exported as `ARTIFACT_PREVIEW_MAX_PAGES` from
  `@vivd-catalyst/core`. A Mailjet send may take 30 s (was 10 s).
  A provider's `Retry-After` replaces the fixed wait up to 60 s; a longer one fails the run at
  once, and no attempt or wait starts past a run's deadline. The preview renderer version is
  `preview-contract-v2`, so every stored preview, including sheets that failed under the old
  cell limit, is rendered once more the next time it is opened.
- **API contract (breaking):** `@vivd-catalyst/api-contract` no longer exports the constant
  `openApiDocument`; call `createOpenApiDocument()`. `createOpenApiDocumentFromOperations`
  takes the operations alone: title and version are those of the release. An operation that
  answers a file states its content type (`blob("text/html")`), and an operation of a
  signed-in caller may state `scope: null` when it asks for no scope.
- **API (operator-relevant):** every operation is rate limited, against spamming and guessing
  only. A call is counted per operation and per caller: the signed-in person or service where
  the operation authenticates one, the client address where it does not. The defaults are 6000
  calls a minute to a reading operation and 1200 a minute to a changing one. A host backend's
  session-token calls are counted under its server credential, 6000 a minute. A caller over a
  limit receives 429 with the code `RATE_LIMITED`, `details.retryAfterSeconds` and a
  `Retry-After` header; the chat interface waits that long and sends an upload again. The new
  release config section `rateLimits` sets `enabled`, `readPerMinute`, `writePerMinute`,
  `signInPerAccountPerMinute` and `signInPerAddressPerMinute`; an instance without the section
  gets the defaults. The counters live in the API process: they start empty after a restart,
  and an instance must run one API process. The client address is taken from
  `X-Forwarded-For` only when the direct peer is a loopback or private address, so the reverse
  proxy in front of the API has to pass the real client address on. Where Caddy sits behind
  another proxy, its Caddyfile needs `servers { trusted_proxies static private_ranges }`, or
  every caller is counted as one address.
- **Sign-in (operator-relevant):** sign-in and password reset are limited to
  10 tries a minute on one account from one client address, and 300 a minute from one address
  whatever the account, so an office behind one address is not locked out by one person. A
  refused API key or server credential is counted per address, 60 a minute, on a counter the
  accepted credential never touches. The sign-in routes under `/api/auth/*` are counted by the
  API before a password is checked and answer with the same 429 as every operation. Until now
  their limit depended on `NODE_ENV=production`, which the reference Compose files do not
  set, so it was off. Reset mails for requests from one client address are capped at 200 an
  hour, up from 20; the cap of three an hour per mailbox stays.
- **Server runtime (breaking):** `createChatServer`, `ClientInstanceApp` and the document
  worker expose `{ fetch(request), listen, close }` and no web framework type.
  `ClientInstanceApp.server` and the worker's `server` are gone: call `app.fetch(new
Request(url))` where code called `app.server.inject(...)`. `listen` resolves with the base
  URL. `createRoute` and `Route` are no longer exported from `@vivd-catalyst/chat-server`.
  The object `createStandaloneAuthRuntime` returns has `routeKind(pathname)`, which the server
  uses to count calls to the sign-in routes.
- **Infrastructure (breaking):** every provider an instance runs on is named in the new
  `infrastructure` section of the instance config, one provider per port: `secrets`, `models`,
  `mail`, `objectStorage.files`, `objectStorage.workspaces` and `sandbox`. The keys
  `modelProviders`, `mail`, `executionWorkspaces.runner` and
  `capabilities.documentProcessing.objectStorage` moved there. Config that still carries one of
  them does not load: startup stops with a message that names the key and its new place. There
  is no transition release, so deploy the config change together with this version. What to
  change:
  - `modelProviders` (a list) becomes `infrastructure.models` (a map): `id` is the map key,
    `type` becomes `provider`, the key's `…EnvName` field becomes `credentialSecret`, the
    organization's becomes `organizationSecret` and `compliance.residency` becomes `region`.
    A residency of `unknown` has no counterpart: state where the provider processes data, and
    `global` when no EU processing is agreed. An id made only of digits is refused, because
    such a key is read before the others and would move the default provider; rename it, also
    where an agent names it.
    Maps merge key by key across `extends` files, so delete an entry of a base file that an
    overlay used to replace. At least one entry is required; the implicit `deterministic`
    default is gone.
  - `mail` becomes `infrastructure.mail`: the two `…EnvName` fields become `apiKeySecret` and
    `apiSecretSecret`, and an instance without mail leaves the key out instead of
    `enabled: false`.
  - `executionWorkspaces.runner` becomes `infrastructure.sandbox`: `mode` becomes `provider`
    (`docker` or `local`). `networkMode` and `readOnlyRootFilesystem` are fixed and no longer
    settings. `EXECUTION_WORKSPACE_RUNNER_IMAGE` still replaces the image of a `docker` sandbox
    and is ignored for any other. A Docker sandbox with an `endpoint` runs on another host and
    must state a `region`; without an endpoint it must not.
  - `capabilities.documentProcessing.objectStorage` becomes `infrastructure.objectStorage.files`:
    `kind` becomes `provider`, the vendor's `region` becomes `bucketRegion`.
    `DOCUMENT_OBJECT_STORE_BUCKET`, `DOCUMENT_OBJECT_STORE_REGION` and
    `DOCUMENT_OBJECT_STORE_ENDPOINT` still replace the entry's values.
  - The variables `EXECUTION_WORKSPACE_OBJECT_ROOT` and `ARTIFACT_PREVIEW_OBJECT_ROOT` are no
    longer read. Name the directory in `infrastructure.objectStorage.workspaces`
    (`provider: filesystem`, `root`), and mount the same directory into the API and its workers.
    Enabled execution workspaces need this entry and `infrastructure.sandbox`. A deployment
    that set the directory through one of the two variables, in Compose or in an environment
    file, moves that path into config and removes the variable; the files stay where they are
    as long as `root` names the same directory.
  - A provider that sends data outside the instance (`openai-compatible`, `mailjet`, `s3`) must
    state `region: eu` or `region: global`; one that keeps data inside must not.
- **Secrets (breaking for integrators):** every secret is taken from one secret resolver, by
  name. The `environment` provider reads the variable of that name and otherwise the file named
  by `<NAME>_FILE`, so a mounted secret works for every secret, including `DATABASE_URL`. Config
  fields that take a secret end in `Secret` and hold its name, never its value. The S3 store
  always takes its credentials by name (default `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
  `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`); the AWS credential chain and the built-in S3Mock credentials are no
  longer used. A deployment that reached S3 through an instance role or another source of the
  AWS credential chain must now provide an access key pair as two named secrets, and a local
  S3Mock that ran without credentials needs both variables set to any value. A name must read
  as an environment variable name (upper-case words joined by underscores, at most 64
  characters); anything else is refused and never repeated in a message, so a credential
  pasted where a name belongs does not reach a log. The same holds for a data source's
  `connectionRef: env:NAME`. A secret whose `<NAME>_FILE` is set and whose file cannot be read
  or is empty stops startup, also for a secret the instance may leave unset. An instance whose
  config carries `auth.sessionToken` no longer starts without `CHAT_SESSION_TOKEN_SECRET` and
  `CHAT_SERVER_CREDENTIAL`: before, it started without session-token sign-in when another
  sign-in path existed. Set both, or remove `auth.sessionToken`. A seed user's
  `passwordEnvName` follows the same naming rule.
  `createClientInstanceApp`, the worker factories and `seedStandaloneAuthUsers` accept a
  `secrets` resolver. `@vivd-catalyst/data-source` no longer exports `createEnvSecretResolver`,
  `createDataSourceRegistry` is asynchronous and takes `secrets`, and
  `createModelProviderRegistry` is asynchronous and takes the instance's provider `registry`. A capability receives `secrets`, `logger` and `objectStorage` in its context and
  may bring provider definitions in `providers`. An artifact preview `sourceReaderFactory`
  receives `context` (the resolver and the logger) for the store it creates.
- **Config API:** a selectable model in the safe config view carries `region` (`eu` or
  `global`) in place of `residency`.
- **Startup messages:** an invalid instance config names the first failing key in the error
  message, not only in its details.
- **Database (operator-relevant):** `infrastructure.database.poolSize` sets how many PostgreSQL
  connections each process of the instance keeps at most; the default is 10, the value until
  now. `createPlatformStore` requires `poolSize` (breaking for integrators that call it).
- **Run start:** a repeated run start with the same idempotency key waits up to 10 seconds for
  the first one, in steps of 100 ms, before it answers 409; until now it waited one second.
- **Jobs:** `JobWorker.idle()` resolves when the worker has no pass and no job in flight and
  sleeps until its next poll.
- **Jobs (operator-relevant):** the API process runs a job executor on the new table
  `platform_jobs` (one migration, which only creates the table and moves no data). It replaces
  the three interval timers for conversation expiry, workspace cleanup and run recovery, and
  the in-process title generation. A job survives a restart: it is leased, retried with
  backoff and recovered when its worker dies. `createClientInstanceApp` starts the worker in
  `listen()` and stops it in `close()`; `createJobWorker` is exported from
  `@vivd-catalyst/client-assembly`. On SIGTERM the worker stops claiming, waits up to 20
  seconds for running jobs and gives the rest back, so the Compose service `api` needs
  `stop_grace_period: 30s`. Ended job rows are removed after 7 days (succeeded, cancelled) or
  30 days (failed, dead).
- **Jobs (operator-relevant, breaking for integrators):** file previews and document
  preprocessing run on the job executor, as the kinds `artifact_preview.render` (two attempts,
  30 seconds apart, a lease of 5 minutes) and `conversation_attachment.preprocess` (three
  attempts, 30 seconds doubling up to 10 minutes, a lease of twice the preprocessing timeout
  and at least a minute). The preview row and the attachment stay the record the interface
  reads; the row and its job are written in one transaction. No migration. A storage
  or database error, or a converter killed by a signal, is now tried three times before the
  attachment shows as failed, and a conversion that timed out twice; a refused or corrupt
  document, such as an unsupported format or a converter ending with an exit code, fails at
  once as before.
  - The preview worker no longer reads `ARTIFACT_PREVIEW_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`,
    `ARTIFACT_PREVIEW_LEASE_DURATION_MS`, `ARTIFACT_PREVIEW_LEASE_RENEW_INTERVAL_MS` and
    `ARTIFACT_PREVIEW_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, and the document worker no longer reads
    `DOCUMENT_WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`. Remove them from the environment.
    `ARTIFACT_PREVIEW_CONCURRENCY` and `DOCUMENT_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` stay: they are how many
    jobs one process runs at once.
  - On SIGTERM both workers give their running jobs back, so the Compose service of the
    document worker needs `stop_grace_period: 30s`, as the preview worker has it.
  - This release can run beside the previous one and be rolled back to it. A job copies its
    lease onto the old lease columns of its row, so a worker of the previous release leaves
    the row alone; the job leaves a row alone while a worker of the previous release holds it;
    and the schedule `platform_jobs.adopt_legacy` gives every unfinished row without a job
    its job once a minute, which covers rows the previous release's API writes. The copy, the
    schedule and the old lease columns go in a later release.
  - `@vivd-catalyst/tool-execution` exports `createArtifactPreviewJobHandler` in place of the
    class `ArtifactPreviewWorker`. `ClientInstanceArtifactPreviewWorker.worker` is a
    `JobWorker` and its `stop()` takes no argument. The file store loses
    `claimNextArtifactPreviewJob`, `recoverStaleArtifactPreviewJobs` and
    `claimNextQueuedConversationAttachment`; a row is claimed by id with
    `claimArtifactPreviewJob` and `claimConversationAttachmentForPreprocessing`.
  - `@vivd-catalyst/capability-sdk` exports `defineJobKind` and `defineJobHandler`. The
    capability context has `jobs`, to enqueue, and `transaction`, to write a record and
    enqueue its job together. An attachment handler may implement `adoptLegacyAttachments`
    for the transition.
- **Audit (breaking, deletes data):** audit retention is enforced. The daily job `audit.prune`
  deletes the instance's audit events older than `retention.auditDays` (default 365) and
  records one `audit.pruned` event with the count. There is no switch. On the first start
  after the upgrade the first run is due at once, so every audit event older than
  `auditDays` is deleted then. Raise `retention.auditDays` (up to 3650) before upgrading if
  older events have to stay.
- **Conversation titles (breaking):** the title is generated by the job
  `conversation.generate_title`, enqueued with the first user message. The operation
  `conversations.title.generate` (`POST /api/v1/conversations/:conversationId/title`) and the API
  client's `conversations.generateTitle` are removed. A client that still calls the route gets
  a 404 and reads the title from the conversation list.
- **Chat server (breaking):** the server options `retentionExpiration` and `runRecovery` are
  removed, with `ConversationRetentionJob`, `createConversationRetentionJob`,
  `ExecutionWorkspaceCleanupJob` and the `start`/`stop`
  of `RunRecoveryWatchdog`. `createChatServerJobs(options)` returns the handlers and schedules
  for a job worker. A store implementation needs `jobs`,
  `audit.deleteAuditEventsOlderThan` and `conversations.replaceConversationTitle`. Runs that a
  process-bound runtime lost with the last process are recovered by an `agent_run.recover`
  tick that is due at every start. The generated title is written only while the conversation
  still carries the title the job read, so a rename by the user stays.

- **Platform store (breaking):** Postgres is the only platform store. The `STORE` environment
  variable is no longer read, so `STORE=memory` no longer starts an instance without a
  database; every process needs `DATABASE_URL`. Remove `STORE` from environment files. The
  `storeMode` option is gone from `createClientInstanceApp`, the worker factories, `listen` and
  the capability context, together with the `PlatformStoreMode` type, and an artifact preview
  `sourceReaderFactory` no longer receives `storeMode`. `@vivd-catalyst/core/testing` and its
  `InMemoryPlatformStore` are removed.
- **Workspaces (breaking):** workspaces are part of every instance, and the switch
  `ui.collaborationWorkspaces.enabled` is removed. Every signed-in user of the interface sees
  the workspace selector at the top of the rail, with the client branding inside it; an
  embedded token session keeps its fixed context and the branding head. Remove
  `ui.collaborationWorkspaces` from config files. For this one release a config that still
  says `enabled: true` loads; `enabled: false`, or any other value, stops the instance at
  startup with a message that names the key. That acceptance ends with the next release. The
  safe config (`GET /api/v1/instance/config`) no longer carries `features.collaborationWorkspaces`:
  deploy the interface and the API together, because an interface built before this release
  reads the new answer as invalid. Creating, browsing and requesting access to a Shared
  Workspace and adding members no longer answer 403 "Collaboration workspaces are not enabled
  for this instance".
- **Views (breaking):** a generated view loads Tailwind CSS and Lucide from the instance, in
  pinned versions under `/app-runtime/view/1/`, and no longer from two public hosts. A reverse
  proxy in front of an instance must route `/app-runtime/*` to the API. The hosts a view may
  load other scripts from are the instance key `views.allowedScriptSrc`, which defaults to
  none; before, the `show_view` tool's `config.allowedScriptSrc` defaulted to every HTTPS
  host. The `show_view` tool takes no config now: any key left there fails validation and
  names the new key. The interface composes a view's head and content policy when it shows
  the view, so the setting also governs views saved earlier: before upgrading, name every
  host saved views still need.
- **Breaking, operations:** migrations run only as an explicit step, and `RUN_MIGRATIONS` is
  gone. Each client builds `dist/migrate.js` (`client.migrate()` in `src/migrate.ts`); the
  Compose `migrate` service runs `node <client folder>/dist/migrate.js` and the API and workers
  wait for it. The API and the workers no longer migrate when they start: a database that
  lacks committed migrations stops them with the missing migration names, and a database
  ahead of the release starts. Remove `RUN_MIGRATIONS` from Compose and environment files and
  replace an inline migration command with the entry; a setup that relied on the API
  migrating at startup must run the step first. `@vivd-catalyst/postgres-store` exports
  `migrateDatabase({ databaseUrl })`, which holds the advisory lock and returns the applied
  names; the `runMigrations` option and the store's `migrate()` are removed.
- **Operations:** schema changes follow expand and contract. `pnpm check:migrations` rejects
  a changed, removed or renamed committed migration and lints every migration the base branch
  lacks against an allow list of additive forms. Any other statement, such as a drop, a
  rename, a type change, `DELETE` or a `DO` block, passes only under
  `-- contract-after: <tag>` once the oldest supported release in
  `packages/postgres-store/migration-policy.json` reached that tag; a required column without
  a default and a blocking index build never pass. A concurrent index build goes in a
  migration of its own and runs outside a transaction. `pnpm test:compatibility` runs the
  database tests of the previous and the oldest supported release against the new schema, and
  `pnpm test:upgrade` migrates a database of the oldest supported release.
- **API (breaking):** every product operation is under `/api/v1`, and no old path answers any
  more. An old path returns 404 `NOT_FOUND` "Operation is not available" with
  `details.reason: "unknown_operation"`; the one exception is the old API-key exchange below.
  A caller changes the path of every request. `/api/conversations…`
  becomes `/api/v1/conversations…`, `/api/collaboration-workspaces…` becomes
  `/api/v1/workspaces…`, `/api/approval-requests…` becomes `/api/v1/approval-requests…`,
  `/api/me…` becomes `/api/v1/me…`, and `/api/password-reset` and `/api/password-setup` gain the
  prefix. Paths carry no role name: `/api/admin/config/…` becomes `/api/v1/instance/config/…`,
  `/api/admin/collaboration-workspaces` becomes `/api/v1/instance/workspaces`,
  `/api/superadmin/users…` becomes `/api/v1/instance/users…`, `/api/superadmin/usage` becomes
  `/api/v1/instance/usage`, `/api/superadmin/api-access/service-principals…` becomes
  `/api/v1/instance/service-principals…`, `/api/superadmin/api-access/credentials/:id/revoke`
  becomes `/api/v1/instance/api-credentials/:id/revoke`, `/api/audit-events` and
  `/api/audit-activities` move to `/api/v1/instance/…`, and `/api/config` and `/api/branding`
  become `/api/v1/instance/config` and `/api/v1/instance/branding`. Rights are unchanged.
  `/health` stays public and unversioned, and `/api/auth/*` stays the sign-in library's mount.
  A reverse proxy that forwards `/api/*` needs no change.
- **Interface:** reload every open tab after the upgrade. A tab loaded before it calls the old
  paths and shows "Operation is not available" with no hint; this release cannot change that
  page. From this release on, the interface shows one notice with a reload action when the
  server answers that it does not know an operation the interface called.
- **API (breaking):** the API-key exchange moved from `POST /api/auth/access-token` to
  `POST /api/v1/auth/access-token`. Session-token issuance for embedding hosts moved from
  `POST /api/superadmin/session-tokens` to `POST /api/v1/instance/session-tokens`, and its
  alias `POST /auth/session-token` is removed. An older CLI, which sends its key as a bearer
  to the old exchange path, reads 401 `UNAUTHENTICATED` "Standalone auth endpoints do not
  accept explicit credential headers" on an instance with standalone sign-in, because the
  sign-in mount refuses the header before it routes, and 404 elsewhere. A backend that issues chat session tokens
  changes its URL; the `x-server-credential` header and the payload are unchanged. Before this
  release is deployed, search the production access log for both old token paths and move any
  caller found.
- **API (breaking):** operation ids are `<resource>.<verb>`, for example `conversations.list`,
  `workspaces.members.add` and `me.get`, in the OpenAPI document and in `apiOperations`. Code
  that read `apiOperations.listConversations` reads `apiOperations["conversations.list"]`.
  The development mail listing moved to `GET /api/v1/dev/captured-mail` and stays out of the
  document, as does `/health`.
- **CLI (breaking):** `catalyst config` signs in with `CATALYST_API_KEY` only. The fallback to
  `CATALYST_SERVER_CREDENTIAL` and `CHAT_SERVER_CREDENTIAL` and its deprecation warning are
  removed; without a key the CLI stops before it sends a request. Create a service principal
  and a key under Administration → API Access and set `CATALYST_API_KEY` wherever the CLI runs.
  The server needs `SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` set, at least 32 characters; without it the
  instance has no API access and the CLI cannot sign in. For a local development instance,
  `catalyst config local-key` creates the principal and key as the seeded superadmin and
  writes the key into `.env`; it refuses any other host. CLI and server ship together: this
  CLI needs a server that answers under `/api/v1`.
- **Client:** `getAuthSession`, `signInWithEmail` and `signOut` are exported from
  `@vivd-catalyst/api-client`; the interface no longer fetches `/api/auth/*` itself.
- **Client (breaking):** the methods of `createApiClient` are derived from the operation
  catalog instead of written by hand or generated. Every operation is one method under the
  segments of its id, and takes one object with the parts its descriptor names:
  `client.conversations.thread.get({ params: { conversationId } })`,
  `client.conversations.list({ query: { collaborationWorkspaceId } })`,
  `client.users.create({ body })`, each with an optional `signal`. The old names are gone, for
  example `client.account.get()` is `client.me.get()`, `client.runs.start(id, input)` is
  `client.conversations.runs.start({ params, body })` and `client.configAssets.export()` is
  `client.config_assets.export()`. A list method answers one page, `{ items, nextCursor }`;
  `listAll((paging) => client.users.list({ query: paging }))` reads a list to its end. A
  stream is an async iterable, resumed with `query: { after }`. A file URL for the browser
  comes from `client.urlFor(operationId, { params, query })`. A success that is not valid JSON
  or does not match the response schema is now an `ApiError` with the response status and the
  parse failure as `payload`, where a schema mismatch was a `ZodError` before; an abort
  through the caller's `signal` rejects with the abort itself, never an `ApiError`; a stream
  that breaks off is an `ApiError` of status 0. The package no longer contains generated code
  and no longer depends on `@hey-api/openapi-ts`; its `generate` script is removed. The
  OpenAPI document of `@vivd-catalyst/api-contract` is unchanged.
- **API (breaking):** every list answers with `{ items, nextCursor }` instead of a bare array.
  `limit` defaults to 50 and accepts 1 to 200, anything else answers 422. `nextCursor` is
  absent on the last page; pass it back as `cursor` with the same filters to read the next
  page. A cursor from another list or with other filters answers 422. The conversation
  resources list carries `items` instead of `resources`, and the agents of a workspace carry
  `items` instead of `agents`, next to `defaultAgentName`. Workspaces in the directory and in
  the administration picker carry `createdAt`, the key they are paged by. The audit
  activity view is not paged: it answers `{ items }` with the latest activities only, at most
  100 from the latest 500 audit events, and takes no `limit` or `cursor`. The shared API
  client keeps returning complete arrays; its audit event helper returns the latest 100
  events.
- **API (breaking):** every timestamp is UTC and ends in `Z`. A timestamp with an offset such
  as `+02:00`, or without a zone, answers 422; this applies to `expiresAt` when an API
  credential is created.
- **API (breaking):** reading no longer creates anything. A list of workspaces or
  conversations does not create the caller's Personal Workspace; call
  `POST /api/v1/workspaces/personal` once instead. A preview read does not start
  the preview; call `POST /api/v1/conversations/{conversationId}/artifacts/{artifactId}/preview`
  or `POST /api/v1/conversations/{conversationId}/attachments/{attachmentId}/preview`, and read
  the preview until it is ready. A preview that was never started reads as `pending` without
  `queuedAt`. The three operations need the scope of the read they replace.
- **API (breaking):** every error answers with
  `{ error: { code, message, correlationId, details? } }`, and the same id in the
  `x-correlation-id` response header. A caller's own `x-correlation-id` request header is
  kept. An unknown path answers 404 in this shape. `RATE_LIMITED` (429) is a new code. An
  `INTERNAL` error always reads "Internal server error".
- **Document worker (breaking):** the worker answers errors in the same envelope,
  `{ error: { code, message, correlationId } }`, instead of the flat `{ code, message }`.
  Deploy the worker and the application of one release together.
- **Chat:** after a restart, an instance that runs agents in its own process ends the runs the
  last process left open, so their conversations accept new messages at once.
- **Chat:** the conversation list is a compact single-line list without the last-updated date.
  A conversation within seven days of its retention date carries an amber clock, on instances
  with `retention.expireConversations` enabled. Its hint names the deletion date; it opens on
  hover and on keyboard focus, and the row's menu repeats it for touch.
- **Administration:** saving an agent or skill confirms it next to the save button until the
  form is edited again.
- **Chat:** the start page introduces the agent with its icon and name, centred above the
  composer: several agents make the name a picker that opens on click, a single agent a plain
  label. In a conversation the header shows the icon alone, and pointing at it opens the agent
  list, with a single agent too. `ui.showAgentName` is now `true` by default, decides
  only whether the start page shows the name beside the icon, and no longer adds the client
  name beneath the agent; with `ui.showAgentName: false` the start page shows the icon alone
  as well.
- **Chat:** the agent list shows each agent's description only with the new
  `ui.showAgentDescriptions: true`; by default it lists the names alone.

### Fixed

- **Chat:** an answer that has just finished gets its work history, its actions and the next
  turn without a reload. An instance that runs its agents in the API process announced the end
  of a run before its stores had recorded it, so a page that read the conversation back at that
  moment was told the run was still going and kept showing the answer as unfinished. The end
  of a run is now announced once it is recorded.
- **Audit:** the audit event for the end of a run (`message.completed`, `message.failed`,
  `message.cancelled`) is written before the run's event stream announces that end. It was
  written beside the stream, so a reader of the audit right after the end could miss it.
- **Conversation rail:** the retention clock of a conversation with a long title can be reached
  with the pointer. The clock stood at the end of the row under the row's menu button, unseen
  until the row is hovered, and moved aside when the button appeared. A row with a clock now
  keeps the room for its menu button, so the clock stays where it is. `NavItem` takes
  `trailingKeepsRoom` for this.
- **Chat:** a conversation opened while another one is answering shows only its own messages.
  Until its thread arrives it is empty, where it used to show the messages and the partial
  answer of the conversation left behind, and the page no longer asks for that conversation's
  run under the address of the one opened.
- **Chat:** an instance configuration that does not load no longer leaves "Loading
  configuration" standing. A request without an answer or with a 5xx is tried three more times;
  after that, or at once for an answer of a shape the interface cannot read, a panel offers "Try
  again" and "Reload". An answer from another release reads as the outdated-tab notice does, and
  the console names the paths of the fields that did not fit, never their values. The client
  reports an answer that does not match its operation's schema as `ApiResponseShapeError`, an
  `ApiError` with those paths, and calls `onResponseMismatch`; the interface then shows the
  reload notice, also for an enum value or a stream event of a later release.
- **Models:** a long conversation no longer fails on every message after the provider compacted
  its context into an item above the provider's limit of 20,971,520 characters per string. Such
  an item, and an encrypted reasoning item of that size, is not kept. A stored one, or one the provider refuses with 400
  `string_above_max_length` on `encrypted_content`, is dropped and the request is sent once more
  from the conversation's history, so affected conversations answer again without a migration.
  A provider's 400 `context_length_exceeded` fails the run with "This conversation is too long
  for the model. Start a new conversation." instead of an internal error.
- **Models:** an image whose data URL would exceed the same limit (about 15 MiB of image bytes) is
  left out of the request to an OpenAI-compatible provider, and the model reads a note in its
  place that an image was too large to include. Such an image used to fail the run with 400
  `string_above_max_length` on every message of the conversation.
- **Models:** images a tool loaded for the model, such as rendered document pages, are sent only
  during the run that loaded them. In later runs the tool result names what each image showed
  (file, page, slide, sheet or range) and the model repeats the tool call to see it again. Every
  request used to carry every such image of the conversation again, which made requests of tens
  of megabytes and provider compaction items above the provider's string limit. Images a user
  attached to a message are still sent in later runs. One request carries at most 32 MiB of image
  bytes (`MODEL_INPUT_IMAGES_MAX_BYTES`); above that the oldest images are named instead of sent.
- **Models:** the image of a page, slide or sheet that the model reads is a rendition of its
  own: JPEG at quality 80 with a long edge of at most 1568 pixels
  (`MODEL_PAGE_IMAGE_MAX_LONG_EDGE_PIXELS`), 0.06 to 0.45 MB a page. The preview worker renders
  it beside each preview page and `workspace.preview_images` gives it to the model; the PNG a
  person sees in a preview is unchanged. The model used to be given that PNG, which the
  renderer scales to 4096 pixels: 0.9 MB for a text page and 17 MB for a colour scan. A preview
  rendered before this release has no such rendition, and the model is given its PNG, counted
  at its real size against the image budget. The artifact preview worker must run this release
  for new previews to carry the rendition.
- **Models:** a run waits out a provider's per-minute rate limit. On HTTP 429, or the same
  refusal inside a stream, a model call waits about 4 s, 8 s, 16 s and 32 s, up to 60 s in
  total, and never sooner than the provider's `Retry-After`; a `Retry-After` beyond what is
  left of the 60 s fails the run at once. As before, this applies only while nothing of the
  answer was shown, and no wait starts past the run's deadline or continues after a cancel. A
  run that still fails on a rate limit reads "The model is receiving too many requests. Try
  again in a minute." with code `RATE_LIMITED` instead of an internal error.
- **Retention:** conversation expiry decides under the conversation's row lock and removes
  data only afterwards. A conversation is expired only if it is still due, or still an
  abandoned draft, at that moment, so a message, an upload or a restored draft attachment that
  arrives while the job runs keeps the conversation and its files. A due conversation with an
  agent run in progress is left for the next run of the job. Deleting a conversation follows
  the same order. When removing stored objects fails, the conversation stays expired or
  deleted, the failure is audited as `conversation.cleanup_failed`, and the retention job
  retries the cleanup on each run and audits `conversation.cleanup_completed` when it is done.
  `conversation.retention_expired` and `conversation.deleted` carry `cleanup: "complete"` or
  `"pending"`. The first retention run after the update also cleans what earlier deleted or
  expired conversations left behind when their cleanup had failed.
- **Workspaces, accounts:** deleting a Shared Workspace, an account or a user answers 409 with
  `details.pendingCleanupCount` while data of its deleted conversations is still being
  removed, and removes nothing further. The conversations are deleted at that point. The
  request completes when it is repeated after the retention job has finished the cleanup. A
  refused account deletion leaves the user with every membership and access request. The
  refusal is audited as `collaboration_workspace.delete_failed` or `user.delete_failed`. The
  retention job now retries pending cleanups before it expires conversations. When only
  execution workspace data of a deleted conversation is left, the workspace cleanup job
  finishes it, not the retention job. No time is promised for the repeat: it succeeds once
  the jobs have run and found nothing left. Both deletions take the workspace row lock first,
  so a conversation that is created in the workspace or moved into it at the same moment
  fails instead of being removed with it.
- **Conversations:** an artifact, a workspace file or a message is written only into an active
  conversation and under the conversation's row lock. A write that arrives after the
  conversation was deleted or expired is refused with `NOT_FOUND`; the writer removes the
  bytes it had already stored, best effort, and logs a failed removal with the object key. An
  agent run or a workspace command that is still working when its conversation is deleted
  fails at its next such write.
- **Attachments:** in an instance without a capability attachment handler, deleting a
  conversation now removes every object its records name, preview images under
  `artifact-previews/` included. Before, those images stayed in storage while their records
  were marked deleted. Images left behind by earlier versions are not removed by this
  release.
- **Audit:** `conversation.cleanup_failed` and `conversation.cleanup_completed` appear in the
  governance tier, and the four new event types have labels in the activity view.

## 0.6.3 — 2026-10-08

### Fixed

- **Chat:** a file is read before its upload request opens, and an upload that fails without an
  answer from the API is retried. A browser that could not read a file promptly used to stall
  the request until the reverse proxy gave up. The remaining error names the file.
- **Models:** a provider `server_error` or `rate_limit_exceeded` inside a Responses stream is
  retried like the same failure on the request. A stream that stays silent for 10 minutes is
  given up as a timeout instead of holding the run until the provider answers.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-10-08

### Changed

- **Chat:** a long user message is collapsed to a few lines with "Show more" and "Show less".

## 0.6.1 — 2026-10-08

### Changed

- **Skill change proposals:** a proposal for a new skill can carry its supporting files in the
  same request: `create_skill` first, followed by `create_resource` operations such as
  `references/checklist.md`. The limit per operation text is 20,000 characters instead of 4,000.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-06

### Added

- **Deployment kit:** the release and deploy tooling of operated instances is the package
  `@vivd-catalyst/deployment-kit` with the command `catalyst-deploy` (`check`, `update-refs`,
  `prepare-workspace`, `publish`, `manifest`, `deploy`). It carries what each deployment repo
  kept as its own copy: the deploy by image digest, release manifests, staging and production
  publishing, Postgres backup and restore with their systemd units, the zram setup, and the
  checks of the worker wiring in Compose. A deployment names its instance in
  `deploy/deployment.env` (`INSTANCE`, `IMAGE_REPOSITORY`, `APP_PACKAGE`,
  `EXECUTION_WORKSPACES`); host paths, dump names and unit names follow from it. The package is
  not published yet and is used from the platform checkout at the pinned ref.

### Changed

- **Deployment kit:** the scripts under `scripts/deployment-kit/` moved into the package. The
  old paths remain as forwarding stubs, so deployments pinned to them keep working.
- **Release check:** `check-release.sh` no longer requires a `deploy/scripts` directory in the
  deployment.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-10-06

### Added

- **Retention:** the hourly retention job removes orphaned managed files. A `managed_files` row
  older than 24 hours that no active conversation refers to, through an attachment of any
  status or as the source of an artifact, is marked deleted and its stored object is removed.
  This reaches what user deletions before 2026-08-31 and interrupted uploads left behind. The
  job records one `storage.orphaned_files_deleted` audit event with counts per run that removed
  something. An attachment handler takes part by implementing the optional
  `deleteOrphanedFileObjects`; without it nothing is removed.

### Fixed

- **Admin pages:** a table taller than the window, such as the user list, scrolls again instead
  of being cut off.
- **show_view:** the layout guidance for views closes two padding loopholes.
- **Conversation rail:** the collapse handle on the rail's edge no longer covers the list's
  scrollbar. It appears while the pointer is on the rail's right border or the handle has
  keyboard focus.
- **Uploads into a deleted conversation:** a draft attachment whose conversation is deleted
  while the file is still arriving is rejected before any bytes are stored. The conversation
  was checked only when the request started, so a slow upload could leave a stored object and
  a `managed_files` row that no deletion would reach.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-06

### Added

- **Retention:** `retention.expireConversations: false` lets a client instance keep
  conversations indefinitely.

### Changed

- **Packaging:** the library packages carry publish metadata for npm (`files`, typed `exports`
  without the `development` condition, restricted access, licence, `engines`) and are no longer
  marked `private`. `pnpm release:check` builds, packs and inspects every tarball and installs a
  consumer set outside the workspace; `pnpm release:metadata` reapplies the shared fields.
  Nothing is published yet.
- **chat-ui:** `tailwindcss` and `tw-animate-css` are peer dependencies. The stylesheet no longer
  scans `chat-standalone`, which has its own stylesheet now, and finds Streamdown's classes when
  installed from a tarball as well as in the workspace.

### Fixed

- **Abandoned draft conversations:** attaching files on the start page and removing them again
  no longer leaves an empty conversation in the rail. `GET /api/conversations` lists a
  conversation without messages only to its creator, and only while it holds draft attachments;
  access by id is unchanged. Removing the last draft attachment returns the composer to the
  start page, and the retention job expires conversations that have had neither messages nor
  draft attachments for 24 hours. This cleanup also runs with
  `retention.expireConversations: false`, which keeps every conversation that has a message or
  a draft attachment.
- The `catalyst` CLI did nothing when started through the `node_modules/.bin` link of an
  installed package.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-06

### Changed

- **Agent model settings:** an agent may offer its users any model binding agents may use. The
  binding-level `userSelectable` key in release config is still accepted but no longer has an
  effect; `agent_models.manage` governs the choice. The agent editor shows one model list with
  a default and a "Selectable by users" tick per model.
- **Reasoning effort per model:** `modelReasoningEfforts` sets the effort for each model an
  agent offers to users, edited per row in the model list. `reasoningEffort` stays the effort
  of the agent's own model and is no longer applied to a model a user picked instead, which
  now runs with its own entry or the binding's default.
- **API:** the safe config view no longer carries the top-level `selectableModels`; use
  `agents[].selectableModels`. The config assets overview no longer carries
  `references.userSelectableModelBindings`.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-06

### Changed

- **Agent model settings:** each agent lists the models chat users may pick in
  `userSelectableModelBindingIds`, editable with `agent_models.manage`. The composer offers the
  agent's own model plus that list instead of every `userSelectable` binding, so a deployment
  that offered a model choice must add the list to its agents to keep it. The safe config view
  carries `agents[].selectableModels`.

### Fixed

- Saving an agent's model settings no longer fails with 403 when its other fields are locked:
  unchanged fields were reported as changed because stored JSON key order differs.
- A rejected save shows the server's message next to the save button.
- Viewers of a shared conversation can no longer interrupt another user's active run.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-06

First versioned release. Compared with production, which runs `staging-2026.09.14-1` (platform
`a2a13a8`, deployed 2026-09-14):

### Added

- **Email:** transactional mail with password reset and user invitations.
- **Approvals:** agents propose skill changes; reviewers approve, reject or request changes on an
  approvals page with an open queue and a collapsed history. Decisions appear in the conversation.
  Release-configured checks fail closed. A reviewer revises someone else's proposal in their own
  conversation.
- **Conversation visibility:** private conversations in Shared Workspaces, with a default per
  workspace.
- **Agent availability:** agents can be limited to selected Collaboration Workspaces.
- **Start page:** centred composer with starter prompts and agent cards.
- **Agent model settings:** model, reasoning effort and fast mode per agent behind the
  `agent_models.manage` permission; fast runs are settled by the tier the provider reports.
- **Operations:** the agent-run worker drains active runs on shutdown; the config CLI detects
  conflicts per asset and lists agents left hidden after a push.

### Fixed

- Workspace conversations stay in the rail on settings, approvals and admin pages.
- User messages with wide code blocks stay inside the thread; code and quotes are readable in
  user message bubbles.
- Forwarding headers are trusted from private proxy peers.
- Emailed password setup completes in one transaction and rejects invalid tokens early.

### Database

Migrations 0025 to 0029. 0027 backfills existing conversations as visible to the workspace; 0028
