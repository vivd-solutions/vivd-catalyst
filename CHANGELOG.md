# Changelog

All platform packages are released in lockstep under one version. Before 1.0 a minor version may
contain breaking changes; a patch version does not.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-06

### Changed

- **Agent model settings:** an agent may offer its users any model binding agents may use. The
  binding-level `userSelectable` key in release config is still accepted but no longer has an
  effect; `agent_models.manage` governs the choice. The agent editor shows one model list with
  a default and a "Selectable by users" tick per model.
- **Reasoning effort per model:** `modelReasoningEfforts` sets the effort for each model an
  agent offers to users, edited per row in the model list. `reasoningEffort` stays the effort
  of the agent's own model and is no longer applied to a model a user picked instead, which
  now runs with its own entry or the binding's default.
- **API:** the safe config view no longer carries the top-level `selectableModels`; use
  `agents[].selectableModels`. The config assets overview no longer carries
  `references.userSelectableModelBindings`.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-06

### Changed

- **Agent model settings:** each agent lists the models chat users may pick in
  `userSelectableModelBindingIds`, editable with `agent_models.manage`. The composer offers the
  agent's own model plus that list instead of every `userSelectable` binding, so a deployment
  that offered a model choice must add the list to its agents to keep it. The safe config view
  carries `agents[].selectableModels`.

### Fixed

- Saving an agent's model settings no longer fails with 403 when its other fields are locked:
  unchanged fields were reported as changed because stored JSON key order differs.
- A rejected save shows the server's message next to the save button.
- Viewers of a shared conversation can no longer interrupt another user's active run.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-06

First versioned release. Compared with the production release of 2026-09-07:

### Added

- **Email:** transactional mail with password reset and user invitations.
- **Approvals:** agents propose skill changes; reviewers approve, reject or request changes on an
  approvals page with an open queue and a collapsed history. Decisions appear in the conversation.
  Release-configured checks fail closed. A reviewer revises someone else's proposal in their own
  conversation.
- **Conversation visibility:** private conversations in Shared Workspaces, with a default per
  workspace.
- **Agent availability:** agents can be limited to selected Collaboration Workspaces.
- **Start page:** centred composer with starter prompts and agent cards.
- **Agent model settings:** model, reasoning effort and fast mode per agent behind the
  `agent_models.manage` permission; fast runs are settled by the tier the provider reports.
- **Operations:** the agent-run worker drains active runs on shutdown; the config CLI detects
  conflicts per asset and lists agents left hidden after a push.

### Fixed

- Workspace conversations stay in the rail on settings, approvals and admin pages.
- User messages with wide code blocks stay inside the thread; code and quotes are readable in
  user message bubbles.
- Forwarding headers are trusted from private proxy peers.
- Emailed password setup completes in one transaction and rejects invalid tokens early.

### Database

Migrations 0025 to 0029. 0027 backfills existing conversations as visible to the workspace; 0028
backfills existing agents as available everywhere.
