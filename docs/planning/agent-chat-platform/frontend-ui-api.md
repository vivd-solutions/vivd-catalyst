# Frontend, UI, And API Client

The stack should provide both an embeddable chat UI and a standalone surface. The chat experience itself should be the same chat in both places.

## UI Stack

- assistant-ui is the default candidate for shared chat UI primitives/runtime.
- shadcn/ui plus Tailwind is the default component/styling layer for non-assistant UI such as login, navigation, buttons, forms, and control-plane panels.
- Use assistant-ui only if it remains fully customizable.
- Do not use Assistant Cloud for auth, persistence, or conversation storage.
- Keep auth, persistence, audit, and conversation storage in our own backend/Postgres.

Recommended packages:

```text
chat-ui          shared chat components and state
chat-widget      embedded shell
chat-standalone  full-page/local chat shell
control-plane    settings/governance/admin shell, may live inside chat-standalone initially
```

The shared `chat-ui` package may wrap assistant-ui components/runtime internally, but the product should expose its own UI composition boundary so embedded and standalone chat surfaces are not coupled directly to assistant-ui decisions.

Non-chat primitives should follow shadcn/ui copy-owned component conventions rather than custom local class systems. Customer branding should be applied through shadcn/Tailwind CSS variables, not bespoke component APIs.

## Standalone Surface And Control Plane

The standalone surface serves two purposes:

1. **Direct chat access**
   - Same chat experience as the embedded widget.
   - Useful for local testing, demos, and direct access through a domain.

2. **Control plane**
   - Basic configuration and governance screens.
   - Can start as routes inside `chat-standalone`.
   - May become a separate package/shell later if it grows.

V1 control-plane candidates:

- view active client-instance release config and config snapshots
- view own conversations
- delete own conversations where allowed
- superadmin usage panel led by model cost summaries, with model calls, provider-reported tokens, configured pricing/limits, and recent model usage events as supporting context
- admin/superadmin view for governance tasks
- inspect/delete conversations and related data where legally/contractually permitted
- view audit and retention-job status

Admin/superadmin access must be explicit, permissioned, and audited. Sensitive-data workflows should not allow broad invisible access to user conversations without a governance reason.

By default, admin/superadmin views should show metadata, deletion workflows, export/request-handling tools, and audit status. Full conversation message access should require an explicit config flag, a permission check, and an audit reason.

The normal chat rail should stay focused on conversations and a single New action. Superadmin/control-plane access should not appear as a primary Chat/Usage segmented control; it should be tucked behind a secondary superadmin-only action because most users will never see or need it.

Composer drafts belong to the active conversation target. Switching conversations should restore that conversation's unsent draft or show an empty composer. The unsaved New conversation screen should have its own draft state and should not create a persisted conversation until the first message is sent.

## Domain UI Outputs

V1 should support typed UI extension points for domain-specific outputs. The first likely example is document processing:

```text
document analysis panel
  -> list uploaded/acquired documents
  -> show extracted fields per document
  -> show confidence/warnings
  -> show comparison against application/email statements
  -> link back to source document
```

These extension points should be typed product surfaces, such as `DocumentAnalysisViewModel` or `ToolResultViewModel`, rather than arbitrary injected frontend code. This keeps the chat shell customizable for real workflows without committing to a broad plugin system in v1.

## Streaming Chat Path

Vercel AI SDK is the default v1 internal candidate for model calls, streaming, provider adapters, and tool-call plumbing. It should stay behind product-owned `Agent Runtime`, `Tool Execution`, API, and message contracts.

Current v1 implementation status: the backend persists the submitted user message, runs the agent, streams Vercel AI SDK UI message chunks over `/api/chat`, persists assistant messages from runtime completion events, and records minimized run/tool audit metadata. assistant-ui consumes that stream through `@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk` inside `chat-ui`; API/auth/persistence remain product-owned.

Current chat-ui implementation status: the active chat surface wraps assistant-ui primitives behind `AssistantChatPanel` and product-owned components. The first polished assistant-ui pass includes Thread/Viewport, Composer, ActionBar copy, markdown/GFM rendering, syntax-highlighted code blocks, error rendering, suggestion prompts, generic tool-call/data part rendering, a visible stop/cancel action while running, and disabled attachment/edit/regenerate affordances where the backend workflow is not complete yet.

Deferred v1 UI controls: feedback/export and branch picker are intentionally out of scope for the next polish pass. Attachment acquisition/upload, dropzone enablement, message editing, and regeneration should move from disabled affordances to active controls only when the corresponding backend contracts and audit semantics are implemented.

```text
assistant-ui
  -> @assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk
  -> Vercel AI SDK transport/streaming
  -> our schema-first chat API
  -> our AgentRuntime
```

## Normal Frontend Server State

TanStack Query is the default for frontend server state outside the Vercel AI SDK streaming chat path:

- conversation lists
- conversation metadata
- authenticated user state
- config and feature flags
- file/upload metadata
- feedback mutations

TanStack Router is the default for the standalone chat UI and any future admin/config UI. The embedded widget should stay router-light unless the embedded experience grows beyond a compact chat surface.

## API Client

The frontend should use a generated or generated-assisted API client for normal HTTP operations. The source of truth should remain the backend's schema-first HTTP contract.

```text
api-contract Zod/product schemas
  -> server route validation
  -> OpenAPI contract
  -> generated API client package
  -> TanStack Query wrappers/query options
  -> chat-widget and chat-standalone
```

The API contract package should be the shared module. The server should not import from the API client adapter; the API client should consume and re-export contract schemas/types where useful.

The generated API client should cover normal request/response operations such as conversations, config, authenticated user state, file metadata, feedback, audit views, and superadmin usage summaries. The live chat stream may use assistant-ui/Vercel AI SDK transport primitives instead of being treated as a normal TanStack Query request.

Usage routes must return minimized metadata only: provider id, model id, token counts, derived cost metadata from release-config pricing, timestamps, correlation ids, and configured pricing/limits. They must not return prompt or completion payloads.

The conversation list must be user-scoped by the backend. The frontend should not filter another user's conversations out of a shared response.

## Client Branding And Theme

Release config should carry customer-specific branding for a client instance:

- client name
- optional logo URL
- theme colors for accent, background, surface, text, muted text, and borders

The standalone surface and embed surface should consume the same safe config view. Customer-specific branding should not require forking `chat-ui`.

The safe config view should expose normalized Client Branding. UI code should not know release-config fallback rules such as defaulting the client name from the client instance display name or resolving theme accent aliases.

API client generator:

**Hey API / `@hey-api/openapi-ts`** is the default v1 generator candidate. It can generate TypeScript SDKs, Zod schemas, and TanStack Query hooks from OpenAPI, which matches the preferred schema/client/query stack.

If Hey API fails during implementation, evaluate Orval or `openapi-typescript`/`openapi-fetch` as fallbacks.
